# Community Storages - My First Mern-Stack App

https://community-storages.web.app/

Users can search for storages by their name, description, or address (google maps supported), and obseeve each storage items

## Storages

After authentication, users can reserve items, manage there on-reserved items list, or add there own new storage. it could be any kind of community storage you want it to be:) 

## Storage Items

A manager will be able to edit his storage, add new items, edit them and manage the reservation process.

## Storage Charts

A storage manager can observe and manage his/hers storage charts (canvasjs, modified to functional components). There are to kinds: 1.ITEMS COUNT - every time a manager choses yo add a new node, it will dinamicly insert a new node to a (two) line chart, that will represent the current (todays date on the x axis) count of total items in the storage, and the total amount of items currently out of the storage by the users. 2.INCOME CHARTS: comes in two modes: 1. income per day for the last 30 days. 2. income per month.
You can print or save a copy of the charts at any given time. 

### Global State Managment

### User Experience
