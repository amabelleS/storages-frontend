Users can search for storages by there name, descriotion, or adress (google maps supported), and obseeve each storage items

## Storages

After authentication, users can reserve items, manage there on-reserved items list, or add there own new storage. it could be any kind of community storage you want it to be:) 

## Storage Items

A manager will be able to edit his storage, add new items, edit them and manage the reservation process.

## Storage Charts

A storage manager can observe and manage his/hers storage charts (canvasjs, modified to functional components). There are to kinds: 1.ITEMS COUNT - every time a manager choses yo add a new node, it will dinamicly insert a new node to a (two) line chart, that will represent the current (todays date on the x axis) count of total items in the storage, and the total amount of items currently out of the storage by the users. 2.INCOME CHARTS: comes in two modes: 1. income per day for the last 30 days. 2. income per month.
You can print or save a copy of the charts at any given time. 

### Global State Managment

By useContext & useReducer only:) 

### User Experience

It's a colorfull playgroud, no gray shades:) The use of colors is ment to draw the user attention were needed. pure css.

### About this project

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
